# Installing Codecs 
You need to play online or offline multimedia content but the content does not play or you receive errors. Usually this is a sign of missing codecs. Due to legal limitations proprietary codecs can't be stored and served directly from the __openSUSE__/__SUSE__ infrastructure. To install certain codec packages you will need to add the Packman repository and install the required software from there. Some commonly used and installed codecs are:

- ffmpeg
- gstreamer-plugins-good
- gstreamer-plugins-bad
- gstreamer-plugins-libav
- gstreamer-plugins-ugly
- libavcodec-full
- vlc-codecs

You can get them using `Zypper`, _OBS Package Installer_ (`opi`) or `YaST`.
## OBS Package Installer 
`opi` can be used to search and install software from the _Open Build Service_ (OBS) and it works on __openSUSE__ and __SUSE__. To install the required codecs:
1. Launch a _terminal emulator_ (_Konsole_, _Gnome Terminal_ etc.),
1. Install `opi`: `sudo zypper install opi`
1. Install codecs with `opi`: `opi codecs`
1. Update the system: `zypper dist-upgrade --from packman`

## The manual way
### Adding the Packman repository
For installing codecs we have to add the Packman repository. Remember if things donâ€™t work after installing the codecs, make sure all your multimedia packages are coming from Packman.

#### Using the command line
Use the following commands to add all of the third-party Packman repository (Packman Essentials is included), according to your installed openSUSE version:
 
##### Tumbleweed
`sudo zypper addrepo -cfp 90 'https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/' packman`

##### Leap
`sudo zypper addrepo -cfp 90 'https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Leap_$releasever/' packman`

#### Using YaST
1. Launch `YaST`,
1. Select _Software Repositories_,
1. Press _Add_ (lower left corner),
1. From the list select _Community repositories_ and press _Next_,
1. Select _Packman Repository_ and press _Ok_.

### Installing codecs
#### Using the command line
1. Refresh your local repository: `sudo zypper ref`,
1. Install some generally needed codecs: `zypper install k3b-codecs ffmpeg lame gstreamer-plugins-libav gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-ugly gstreamer-plugins-good gstreamer-fluendo-mp3 libdvdcss2`,
1. Update everything to the latest Version `zypper dist-upgrade --from packman`.

#### Using YaST
1. Launch `YaST`,
1. Select _Software Management_,
1. View > Repositories > Packman Repository,
1. Click "Switch system packages" to packages from Packman repository.

Furthermore you can type in the _Search_ field the name of the codec packages you're looking for.
