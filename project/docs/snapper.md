## Snapper
Snapper is a tool for filesystem snapshot management. It can create, delete and compare snapshots and undo changes from one snapshot to the next. Snapper is a powerful maintenance tool to keep your system running, with very little downtime, if something should go wrong. Snapper has both a __Command Line Interface__ (CLI) and __Graphical Interface__, not all functionality is available through the graphical interface but inexperienced users should find it sufficient for basic Snapper tasks.

Snapper is deeply integrated with the Btrfs filesystem, serving as an easy to use helper for the built in functions of Btrfs. The most common Btrfs tasks can be conducted with Snapper, however, there may be instances when it is necessary to interact with Btrfs directly.

Tumbleweed users should note that understanding how to use Snapper is an important step in maintaining a stable, functional system. As a rolling release, Tumbleweed, is subjected to less testing overall and the occasional system breaking update can be installed. Such problems are quickly and easily resolved with Snapper. 

#### Snapper capabilities
- Undo system changes made by `zypper` and YaST.
- Restore files from previous snapshots.
- Do a system rollback by booting from a snapshot.
- Manually create and manage snapshots, within the running system.

### Defaults
By default, openSUSE Tumbleweed formats your hard drive with the Btrfs filesystem which provides the powerful snapshot capabilities. Snapshots are automatically enabled for the root partition `/`.

The default snapshot configuration should only be changed by experienced users but it is important to note some default behaviour for new users as well.

* Snapshots are automatically enabled for the root `/` partition if it is larger than 16 Gigabytes. This is to ensure there is enough disk space for the snapshots and important system tasks to occur, which may include moving, writing or deleting files.

* If the root `/` partition is smaller than 16 Gigabytes a different kind of snapshot is used, known as "Timeline Snapshots". These snapshots are created every hour. By default only the first snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. This ensures there are some snapshots for system rollbacks while taking up very minimal disk space.

* The users `/home` directory is not included in snapshots and should not be relied on as a data backup for personal files. This prevents data loss if a system rollback is conducted. Changes to personal files would also be "undone".

* Directories `/opt` and `/usr/local`, where various software and third-party products are installed are not included in snapshots by default. This prevents uninstalling the software if a system rollback is conducted.    

### Choosing a Snapshot 
#### Snapshot Types
`snapper` features 3 types of snapshots: _Timeline_, _Installation_, and _Administration_.


* __Timeline__ snapshots are single snapshots, created every hour and old snapshots are automatically deleted. By default, the first snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. Disabled by default on partitions larger than 16 Gigabytes. The only single snapshots present may be the ones created when openSUSE was installed.
* __Installation__ snapshots are created in pairs (_Pre_ and _Post_) when packages are installed with YaST or Zypper. Snapshot pairs are marked as __important__ if an important system component, such as the kernel, has been installed. Enabled by default.
* __Administration__ snapshots are created in pairs (_Pre and Post_) when system administration is performed using YaST. The Pre snapshot is created when a YaST module is started and the Post snapshot is created when the module is closed. Enabled by default.

!!! note
    The last ten important and the last ten regular snapshot pairs are kept. This total encompasses both Installation and Administration snapshot types. Snapshots are automatically deleted when they take up too much space on the disk, but four important and two regular snapshots are always kept.

#### Identifying Snapshots

There are two ways to identify which snapshot you may want to rollback to: 
* with the `snapper` command line utility
* with the _YaST_ utility at _YaST_ > _Filesystem Snapshots_

Snapper command line:

`$ sudo snapper list`

    $ sudo snapper list

__Snapper YaST interface example__

![YaST filesystem snapshots](image/snapper_post_zypper.png)

!!! note
    As snapshots are viewed, `snapper` will create more snapshots, because administrative tasks are being performed. 
    
Moving forward with the assumption there was an issue with the last `zypper` update, #47 is chosen as the snapshot to recover.
### Initiating Rollback
Upon identification of a recovery snapshot, reboot openSUSE. At the boot menu, scroll down to, and select, __Start bootloader from a read-only snapshot__.

![Boot Menu Selection](image/snapper_boot_selection.png)

On the Read-only Snapshot menu, scroll down to, and select, the desired recovery snapshot. Snapshot #47 is used here as an example. openSUSE will appear to boot as normal.

!!! tip
    There isn't a scroll indicator on the Read-only Snapshot Menu, but it is possible to scroll down to select more options, if available.

### Finalizing Rollback
Once your system has booted, the rollback is completed by running:

`$ sudo snapper rollback`

Your system should then be rebooted and the recovered snapshot will be the new default boot option.
